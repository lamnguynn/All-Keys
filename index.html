            Lam Nguyen operates the website and the “All Keys" mobile application (the “Service”).
            <br> <br>
            The app is made available to you on an “as in”, “with all faults and “as available” basis. I cannot guarantee that the app will function or maintain the same level of service in the future. 
            <br> <br>
            Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of “All Keys". By downloading "All Keys", your use of the app is at your own discretion and risk. “All Keys" makes no claims or promises with respect to the quality, the accuracy or reliability of the app, its safety or security, or its content. </p>

        <hr width="600", align="left">
        <p style="color: gray;">
            Your privacy is very important to me, and the app strives to protect that by using Apple's Keychain API to be able to securely store your credentials in an encrypted database called a keychain. More information can found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services" target="_blank"> here.</a> Additionally, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee the absolute security. For the best security, please enable password lock on your device.

        <h2> Why do I need to collect and process some of your data?</h2>

        <p style="color: gray;"> 
            The app collects and stores sensitive information including and not limited to usernames, emails, names, and/or passwords. This is done to provide the user a way to store their credentials and easily be able to access them. In no instance is ANY of this sensitive information shared to a third party or advertising company. I (the developer) will additionally NOT be able to access ANY information added to the app. Everything is local to the user's device only. Because of the nature of this, I advise all users to be careful when deleting the entire app, since it will delete ALL credentials permanently with no backups.
        </p>
